🧠 Recommended Approach for Your System:
Health Workers Register Child
Health workers add a new child profile after birth or during the first vaccine visit.
They enter the parent/guardian contact details (email, phone) to create the parent account automatically.
A notification or login link is sent to the parent.


Guardian View-Only Role
Parent cannot add new child profiles themselves to prevent duplicate or incorrect entries.
Parent can view all registered children under their account, see schedules, download reports.


Optional Parent Request Feature
Parent can submit a “Request to Register Child” if they don’t see their child in the system.
Health worker can review and approve that request.



🎯 ✅ Summary

✅ 🧠 Workflow Example for Health Workers
Health worker registers new child → system auto-generates all scheduled vaccines.
Health worker visits dashboard → sees list of due vaccines.
Administers dose → updates Vaccination_Record as given with date_given.
Next due date is computed automatically using dose_interval_days.
Parent/Guardian sees updated info instantly on dashboard.
